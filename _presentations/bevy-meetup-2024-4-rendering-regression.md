How to test a game engine on macOS, Linux, Window, iOS, Android, WebGL2, WebGPU? [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) does it (almost) all, and in CI!

Let's talk about the tooling Bevy provides to help tests, and the tools used to run those tests, like [GitHub actions](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy-example-runner/actions), [Pixel Eagle](https://pixel-eagle.com/project/B25A040A-A980-4602-B90C-D480AB84076D) and [the resulting reporting page](https://thebevyflock.github.io/bevy-example-runner/index.html).
