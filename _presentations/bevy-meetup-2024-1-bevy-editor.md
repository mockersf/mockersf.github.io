[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) doesn't have an editor, but initiatives and prototypes are starting... which means it's the perfect time to look at what others are doing.

Outside of the common scene view that all game engine editors seem to have, what would be an ECS engine editor? What does it means to edit entities, components and systems?

Bevy has a few plugins that try to explore this space, but we should also look at the competition, like the [Flecs Explorer](https://www.flecs.dev/explorer/) or [Unity DOTS Editor](https://unity.com/dots).
