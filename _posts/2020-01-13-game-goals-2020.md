My game goals for 2020

After a lot of thinking and false starts, I'll finally try making my dream game! A mix between a RTS, a MMO, a 4X.... so, big dreams. To quote a few games that will serve as my inspiration:
* [Escape Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game))
* [Spaceward Ho!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceward_Ho!)
* [Anno 1602](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1602)
* [Civilization II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_II)
* [The Settlers II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_II)
* [Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty:_The_Fantasy_Kingdom_Sim)

Those are the games that I kept going back to in my youth... Some of which I modded to death and know by heart.

After trying a dozen times to get started but always hitting a wall somewhere, I think this time I'll be able to reach something:
* I recently discovered [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io), an excellent Escape Velocity like open source game, with exceptional content. Luckily for me, everything is available to reuse, and I plan to use it as a base to start building my game
* After trying out [Godot](https://godotengine.org), I feel I can do something playable. It helps that the [Rust bindings](https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/godot-rust) are good

So the goal for 2020 is to have a light version of Endless Sky, and then see where I can go from there:
- __January__: have a first version running, being able to fly a spaceship around, CI and builds setup
- __February__: be able to parse data files from Endless Sky
- __March__: have the galaxy map from Endless Sky and be able to move around it in a ship
- __April__: commerce is possible between planets
- __May__: other ships are present, but just move randomly
- __June__: ship equipment can be bought and used
- __July__: can attack other ships
- __August__: other ships have logical behaviour
- __September__: player can control fleet
- __October__: introducing factions
- __November__: missions are now possible
- __December__: and finally storyline!

If all goes well with this plan, I should have a game very close to Endless Sky by the end of the year, and a good basis to start expending in any way I want. Of course there's always the risk that I'm over ambitious, and will scale down my goal to a game closer to Spaceward Ho!, which would still be great. I'll post monthly updates to check my progress against this roadmap, and possibly update it.

Let's see what I can do this year!
